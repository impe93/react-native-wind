# react-native-wind

## What is it?

This library comes from the need to write the style of an application in a quick and simple way, using a concise and easy to remember API.

React Native Wind is strongly inspired by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and, as you will see, even the names of the classes used are often the same.

React Native Wind is a utility-first style library that offers a low-level API. By using this approach you avoid writing the same style rules over and over again. These rules can be composed to create most of your necessary styles.

## Documentation

On the official documentation you can find all the information on how to use the library.
